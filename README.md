## About

If:
- you want an effortless way of adding and using custom fonts in your iOS projects
<br> *or* <br>
- you want to load fonts from your custom Bundle(s)
<br> *or* <br>
- you want to load and use fonts not bundled with the app

then **Elefont** is what you need.

## Features
- [x] Imports fonts from `Bundle.main`
- [x] Imports fonts from custom Bundle(s)
- [x] Imports fonts from any local URL or path
- [x] CocoaPods Support

## Installation

### CocoaPods
```ruby
pod 'Elefont'
```

### Manual

1. [Download Elefont](http://github.com/mihaicristiantanase/Elefont/archive/master.zip).
2. Copy `Sources/Elefont.swift` into your project.

## Usage

A typical custom font integration *without* Elefont goes like this:
1. Include your fonts to the Xcode project;
2. Create a list with those fonts and update the `Info.plist` file;
3. Use the fonts in the `Storyboard`/`Xib` or programmatically with<br>
`UIFont(name: "<font-postscript-name>", size: <size>)`

If you've integrated custom fonts in your iOS projects (I'm assuming you did given that you looked for a better solution here), then you know what a hassle step 2 (ex: wrong font file names) and step 3 (wrong font PostScript names, which is **not** the font file names).

Luckily, Elefont solves those two annoyances with this line:
```Swift
Elefont.eat()
```
which will load all the fonts in `Bundle.main`, completely removing step 2 and providing the PostScript names for the loaded fonts.

But what if your fonts are in a custom Bundle? Well, no problem:
```Swift
Elefont.eat(bundle: <custom_bundle_object>)
```

I've mentioned earlier that Elefont can load fonts from local URL or path. Here's how you can do that:
```Swift
Elefont.eat(at:)
// or
Elefont.eat(atPath:)
```

Each of the methods above can be called with a completion handler, in case you need a list of all of the loaded fonts generated by the load operation:

```Swift
Elefont.eat(/* arguments */) { fonts in
  print(fonts)
}
```

If you need to debug font loading, set `debugEnabled = true`:
```Swift
Elefont.debugEnabled = true
```

## Public API
Below are all the possible variations of Elefont usage (`fonts` is an array of Strings containing PostScript font names):
```Swift
// 1. Load from main Bundle without callback
Elefont.eat()

// 2. Load from main Bundle with callback
Elefont.eat { fonts in
  print(fonts)
}

// 3. Load from custom Bundle without callback
Elefont.eat(bundle:)

// 4. Load from custom Bundle with callback
Elefont.eat(bundle:) { fonts in
  print(fonts)
}

// 5. Load from local URL without callback
Elefont.eat(at:)

// 6. Load from local URL with callback
Elefont.eat(at:) { fonts in
  print(fonts)
}

// 7. Load from local path without callback
Elefont.eat(atPath:)

// 8. Load from local path with callback
Elefont.eat(atPath:) { fonts in
  print(fonts)
}
```

## Demo Project
You can use the ElefontDemo/ElefontDemo.xcodeproj project to see Elefont for loading fonts from main Bundle and from a URL path.
Press "Load fonts" button to see the texts update with their corresponding fonts.
